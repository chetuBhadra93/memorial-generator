# üåü Memorial Story Generator: AI-Powered Legacy Preservation Platform

## Overview

**Memorial Story Generator** is an innovative AI-powered platform that transforms the way we create, share, and preserve memories of our loved ones. Built for the [Google Gemini Nano Banana Hackathon](https://github.com/google-gemini/nano-banana-hackathon-kit), this project leverages **Gemini 2.5 Flash Image Preview** to solve real-world problems in memorial services, grief support, and legacy preservation.

### üéØ Problem Statement

**The Challenge**: Creating meaningful, personalized memorial tributes is emotionally overwhelming and technically challenging for grieving families. Traditional memorial services lack personalization, while digital alternatives are often impersonal or require technical expertise.

**The Solution**: An AI-powered platform that understands the emotional context of loss and generates beautiful, personalized memorial content that honors the unique life and impact of each individual.
